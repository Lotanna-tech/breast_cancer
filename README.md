🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to detect breast cancer from histopathological images. The model classifies images into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal, using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor via TensorFlow Hub.

A user-friendly Streamlit web interface allows users to upload an image and instantly receive a prediction, making this project a potential tool for educational, research, and prototype clinical applications.
